AnyLogic code is written using AnyLogic version 8.7.9 but will run in newer versions

AnyLogic can be downloaded and installed at: https://www.anylogic.com/downloads/
There is a free personal learning edition that can load the model and run the
model at low agent counts. To run the model after installing AnyLogic, open Prosociality_Model_ABM_2.alp
in AnyLogic. Under Projects, right click Simulation:Main and run it.
This will run under the parameter settings set in "Simulation".
